# Virual Account Challenge

In the [Virual Account Challenge](https://www.ximedes.com/ximedes-virtual-account-challenge/)[Ximedes](http://www.ximedes.com)
  asked developers to create a highly available, scalable, consistent system of accounts.

This repository contains the source code of a simple program, 
which participants can use to verify proper working of their system.

This is NOT the actual tool, which will be used to verify and benchmark the submitted solutions.
